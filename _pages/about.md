I am currently a Lecturer at the School of Statistics and Mathematics at the Zhejiang Gongshang University. I was awarded a Ph.D. in Statistics from East China Normal University in June 2025, under the supervision of Professor Riquan Zhang. My research interests include high-dimensional hypothesis testing, image data analysis, and survival analysis. I have published in several prominent journals, such as Bernoulli,  Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, Journal of Nonparametric Statistics and Scientia Sinica Mathematica.
